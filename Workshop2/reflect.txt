In this workshop i was able to able the new concept i learned which is the rule of 5 that has 2 addition operations called move copy constructor and 
move copy assignment operator.

in copying and moving data copying take longer versus moving it another place.
for example if i saw a car that i liked in stead of taking the options i like in this car and giving it to the company to forward it to the factory will take longer
but if I offered to buy this car from its owner the process will be faster than copying it, even though its a real life example but its similar to what happens in memory

yes there is by storing the data temporarily.

The steady clock is for measuring tiny nanosecs of time very precisely, while the system clock tells you the time you use in your daily life.
