In this workshop I learned a new concept in OOP called multi-threading.it is like having multiple workers in a team 
and the code used this idea to make things happen faster.
for example, when finding averages and variances threads worked on different parts simultaneously

managing these threads was a little bit tricky, and the code needed to be careful about sharing information between them but by using references, like pointers, helped avoid conflicts.

avgThreads.push_back(std::thread(std::bind(computeAvgFactor, data, p_indices[i], p_indices[i + 1], std::ref(partialAvgs[i]))));
varThreads.push_back(std::thread(std::bind(computeVarFactor, data, p_indices[i], p_indices[i + 1], avg, std::ref(partialVars[i]))));

also I found out that using binary files is better for storing data because it is a more efficient and faster way compared to text files,
and it keeps data intact and compact which is handy when dealing with a lot of information.
